"""Assignment 1 - Scheduling algorithms (Task 4)

This module contains the abstract Scheduler interface, as well as the two
classes RandomScheduler and GreedyScheduler, which implement the two
scheduling algorithms described in the handout.

Your task is to implement RandomScheduler and GreedyScheduler.
You may *not* change the public interface of these classes, except that
you must write appropriate constructors for them.  The two constructors do not
need to have the same signatures.

Any attributes you use must be private, so that the public interface is exactly
what is specified by the Scheduler abstract class.

class Scheduler:
    """A scheduler, capable of deciding what parcels go onto which trucks, and
    what route each truck will take.

    This is an abstract class.  Only child classes should be instantiated.

    You may add *private* methods to this class so make them available to both
    subclasses.
