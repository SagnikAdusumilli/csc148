    Items are removed from the queue according to priority; the item with the
    highest priority is removed first.  Ties are resolved in first-in-first-out
    (FIFO) order, meaning the item which was inserted *earlier* is the first one
    to be removed.

    Priority is defined by the <less_than> function that is provided at time
    of construction.  If x < y, then x has a *HIGHER* priority than y.
    (Intuitively, something with "priority 1" is more important than something
    with "priority 10".)

      The end of the list represents the *front* of the queue, that is,
      the next item to be removed.
    @type _less_than: Callable[[Object, Object], bool]
      If x._less_than(y) is true, then x has higher priority than y
      and should be removed from the queue before y.

    === Representation Invariants ===
    - all elements of _queue are of the same type
    - the elements of _queue are appropriate arguments for function less_than
    - the elements of _queue are in order according to function less_than.
