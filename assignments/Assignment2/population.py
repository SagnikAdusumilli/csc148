"""Assignment 2: Modelling Population Data

=== CSC148 Fall 2016 ===
Diane Horton and David Liu
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module Description ===
This module contains a new class, PopulationTree, which is used to model
population data drawn from the World Bank API.
Even though this data has a fixed hierarchichal structure (only three levels:
world, region, and country), because we are able to model it using an
AbstractTree subclass, we can then run it through our treemap visualisation
tool to get a nice interactive graphical representation of this data.

NOTE: You'll need an Internet connection to access the World Bank API
to get started working on this assignment.

Recommended steps:
1. Read through all docstrings in this files once. There's a lot to take in,
   so don't feel like you need to understand it all the first time.
   It may be helpful to draw a small diagram of how all the helper functions
   fit together - we've provided most of the structure for you already.
2. Complete the helpers _get_population_data and _get_region_data.
   Both of these can be completed without recursion or any use of trees
   at all: they are simply exercises in taking some complex JSON data,
   and extracting the necessary information from them.
3. Review the PopulationTree constructor docstring. Note that when the first
   parameter is set to False, this behaves exactly the same as the
   AbstractTree constructor.
4. Complete _load_data. Use the PopulationTree constructor, but you should
   only need to pass in False for the first argument (this allows you to
   create the region and country nodes directly, without trying to access
   the World Bank API again).
