"""Assignment 2: Treemap Visualiser

=== CSC148 Fall 2016 ===
Diane Horton and David Liu
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module Description ===
This module contains the code to run the treemap visualisation program.
It is responsible for initializing an instance of AbstractTree (using a
concrete subclass, of course), rendering it to the user using pygame,
and detecting user events like mouse clicks and key presses and responding
to them.
