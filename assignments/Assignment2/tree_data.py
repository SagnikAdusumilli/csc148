"""Assignment 2: Trees for Treemap

=== CSC148 Fall 2016 ===
Diane Horton and David Liu
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module Description ===
This module contains the basic tree interface required by the treemap
visualiser. You will both add to the abstract class, and complete a
concrete implementation of a subclass to represent files and folders on your
computer's file system.

class AbstractTree:
    """A tree that is compatible with the treemap visualiser.

    This is an abstract class that should not be instantiated directly.

    You may NOT add any attributes, public or private, to this class.
    However, part of this assignment will involve you adding and implementing
    new public *methods* for this interface.

    === Public Attributes ===
    @type data_size: int
        The total size of all leaves of this tree.
    @type colour: (int, int, int)
        The RGB colour value of the root of this tree.
        Note: only the colours of leaves will influence what the user sees.

    === Private Attributes ===
    @type _root: obj | None
        The root value of this tree, or None if this tree is empty.
    @type _subtrees: list[AbstractTree]
        The subtrees of this tree.
    @type _parent_tree: AbstractTree | None
        The parent tree of this tree; i.e., the tree that contains this tree
        as a subtree, or None if this tree is not part of a larger tree.

    === Representation Invariants ===
    - data_size >= 0
    - If _subtrees is not empty, then data_size is equal to the sum of the
      data_size of each subtree.
    - colour's elements are in the range 0-255.

    - If _root is None, then _subtrees is empty, _parent_tree is None, and
      data_size is 0.
      This setting of attributes represents an empty tree.
    - _subtrees IS allowed to contain empty subtrees (this makes deletion
      a bit easier).

    - if _parent_tree is not empty, then self is in _parent_tree._subtrees

        If <subtrees> is not empty, <data_size> should not be specified.
